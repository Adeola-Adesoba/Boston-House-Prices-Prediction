It also explored other Machine Learning Models such as Decision Tree, Support Vector Regressor and Multiple Layer Perceptron.

The Models were evaluated using the adjusted R-squared metric and it was concluded that the MLP regressor model performed better that is, predicted the median value on the test housing prices data with R^2 of 87%. Therefore, increasing savings of $40,000 -$50,000 for home buyers.
