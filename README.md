This notebook investigated and predicted the housing prices in Boston using Linear Regression Model

It also explored other Machine Learning Models such as Decision Tree, Support Vector Regressor and Multiple Layer Perceptron.

The Models were evaluated using the adjusted R-squared metric and it was concluded that the MLP regressor model performed better on the test data with R^2 of 87% prediction
accuracy.
